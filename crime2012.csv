1 Includes offenses reported by the Zoological Police and the Metro Transit Police.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 The data collection methodology for the offense of forcible rape used by the Minnesota state Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program (with the exception of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota) does not comply with national UCR Program guidelines.  Consequently, its figures for forcible rape and violent crime (of which forcible rape is a part) are not published in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 Because of changes in the state/local agency's reporting practices, figures are not comparable to previous years' data.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE:  Although arson data are included in the trend and clearance tables, sufficient data are not available to estimate totals for this offense.  Therefore, no arson data are published in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,
